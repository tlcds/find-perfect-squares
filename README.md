# Find perfect squares

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use F# and the actor model to find all k consecutive numbers starting at 1 and up to N, 
such that the sum of squares is itself a perfect square (square of an integer).

```
Let 1 <= n <= N, check if n^2 + (n+1)^2 + (n+2)^2 + ... + (n+k-1)^2 is a perfect square.
```

## Getting Started
```
dotnet run [N] [k]
```
